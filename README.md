# University Projects Repository

This repository contains two separate university projects, each located in its own folder. All models were implemented manually without relying on external machine learning libraries for training.

1. **Neural Networks Regression Project**  
   Focused on regression tasks using custom-built Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks.

2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM) Project**  
   Focused on binary and multiclass classification using manually implemented SVMs with different kernels and decomposition algorithms.

Each project folder contains:
- The **project report** detailing the technical implementation.
- The **project assignment** for reference.
- The **code**, divided into question folders according to the assignment.

Each question folder inside the project folder contains:
- A `functions` file containing the necessary helper functions.
- A `run` file which executes the experiments using the functions provided.

To run any experiment, execute the `run` file in the corresponding question folder. All helper functions are self-contained within the `functions` files.
